## Building ROS 2 Packages and Launch Systems

This chapter covers the process of creating and organizing ROS 2 packages, along with using launch files to manage complex robotic systems with multiple nodes.

### Package Structure

ROS 2 packages are the fundamental building blocks of any robotic application. Understanding the proper structure and organization is crucial for maintainable code.

### Launch Files

Launch files allow you to start multiple nodes with a single command, configure parameters, and manage the overall system architecture.
