## Advanced Simulation Techniques

This chapter covers advanced simulation techniques that enhance the realism and utility of robotic simulations, including physics tuning, sensor simulation, and domain randomization.

### Physics Tuning

Adjusting simulation parameters to better match real-world behavior and reduce the sim-to-real gap.

### Sensor Simulation

Accurately simulating various sensors including cameras, LIDAR, IMUs, and force/torque sensors for realistic perception.
