## Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) architecture, which serves as the nervous system of modern robotic systems.

### What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to address the limitations of ROS 1 and provide a more robust, scalable, and production-ready framework for robotics development.

### Key Concepts

- Nodes: Independent processes that perform computation
- Topics: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- Services: Synchronous request/response communication pattern
- Actions: Asynchronous request/response with feedback and goal preemption
