## Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Models

This chapter introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which represent the cutting edge of robotic learning by combining visual perception, natural language understanding, and action generation in unified models.

### VLA Fundamentals

Understanding the architecture and training methodologies of Vision-Language-Action models that enable robots to understand and execute complex tasks based on visual and linguistic inputs.

### Applications in Robotics

Exploring how VLA models are revolutionizing human-robot interaction and enabling more intuitive robotic control.
