## Capstone Project: Integrated Robotic System

This capstone project integrates concepts from all previous modules to build a complete robotic system that demonstrates the full pipeline from low-level control to high-level AI decision making.

### Project Overview

The capstone project involves creating a robotic system that combines:
- ROS 2 for communication and control (Module 1)
- Simulation environment with Gazebo/Unity (Module 2)
- AI capabilities with NVIDIA Isaac™ (Module 3)
- Vision-Language-Action understanding (Module 4)

### Integration Challenges

Addressing the challenges of integrating different components into a cohesive robotic system, including timing, synchronization, and data flow management.

### Implementation Steps

A step-by-step guide to implementing the complete integrated system with all components working together.
