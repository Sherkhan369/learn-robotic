## Creating Robot Models in Gazebo

This chapter covers the process of creating robot models for simulation in Gazebo, including URDF and SDF formats and their integration with the simulation environment.

### URDF vs SDF

Understanding the differences between Universal Robot Description Format (URDF) and Simulation Description Format (SDF) for describing robot models.

### Model Components

Creating links, joints, and visual elements that accurately represent the physical robot in the simulation environment.
