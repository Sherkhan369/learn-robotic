## Introduction to Gazebo Simulation

This chapter introduces Gazebo as a 3D simulation environment that enables the development and testing of robotic systems in a virtual environment before deployment on physical robots.

### What is Gazebo?

Gazebo is a physics-based simulation engine that provides realistic simulation of robotic systems. It includes high-fidelity physics, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces.

### Key Features

- Physics simulation with multiple engines (ODE, Bullet, Simbody)
- High-quality rendering with support for realistic sensors
- Plugin architecture for custom functionality
- Integration with ROS and ROS 2
