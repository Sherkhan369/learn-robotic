# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This educational resource is designed to guide you through the fundamental concepts, technologies, and practical applications of intelligent robotic systems.

## Course Overview

This textbook is structured into four comprehensive modules, each building upon the previous to provide a complete understanding of modern robotics:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Foundation of robotic communication and control
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Simulation and virtual environments for robotics
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Artificial intelligence integration in robotics
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Advanced multimodal robotic systems

## Learning Objectives

By completing this textbook, you will:

- Understand the core principles of robotic systems and their components
- Master ROS 2 for robotic communication and control
- Develop simulation environments using Gazebo and Unity

- Create advanced Vision-Language-Action robotic systems
- Build complete robotic applications that integrate all components

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Computer science and engineering students
- Robotics researchers and professionals
- AI and machine learning practitioners
- Anyone interested in building intelligent robotic systems

## How to Use This Textbook

Each module contains multiple chapters with:
- Theoretical foundations
- Practical examples and code snippets
- Hands-on exercises
- Key takeaways and learning objectives
- References to additional resources

We recommend following the modules sequentially to build a strong foundation, though advanced readers may navigate based on their specific interests.
