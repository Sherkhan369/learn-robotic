## Services and Actions in ROS 2

This chapter covers the different communication patterns available in ROS 2 beyond topics, including services for synchronous communication and actions for more complex interactions.

### Services

Services provide a request/reply communication pattern that is synchronous and blocking. A service client sends a request and waits for a response from the service server.

### Actions

Actions are designed for long-running tasks that may take some time to complete. They provide feedback during execution and allow for goal preemption.
