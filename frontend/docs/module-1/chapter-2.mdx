## ROS 2 Nodes and Communication

This chapter explores ROS 2 nodes and communication mechanisms in detail, focusing on how different components of a robotic system communicate with each other.

### Nodes in Depth

A node is an executable that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes. Nodes are organized into a graph structure for processing data in a distributed fashion.

### Topics and Publishers/Subscribers

Topics enable asynchronous communication through a publish/subscribe model where publishers send messages to topics and subscribers receive messages from topics.
